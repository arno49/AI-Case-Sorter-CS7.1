SvelteKit SSR/Node.js workspace for the browser-facing BFF and operator UI. The
browser will communicate only with this service; direct daemon and serial access
are outside this workspace's boundary.

Use Node.js 22.12 or newer and npm 10.9 or newer; `.nvmrc` selects Node 22.

## Developing

Install the locked dependencies and start a development server:

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

## Building

Type-check and create the Node SSR production bundle:

```sh
npm run check
npm run build
```
